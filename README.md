# get_next_line
This is my implementation of the get_next_line project from 42 school.

Description : 
get_next_line is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it as a string. 
The function can be called repeatedly to read successive lines from the same file descriptor. 
The function is designed to work with multiple file descriptors and to handle input from standard input and/or files.
